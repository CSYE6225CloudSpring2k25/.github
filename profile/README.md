### 🌩️ Nebula of Innovation
- **Webapp**: A Node.js-powered REST API galaxy, orbiting with:  
  - Secure S3 file uploads guarded by IAM roles.  
  - Automated deployments via GitHub Actions.  
  - CloudWatch logging for real-time insights.  
- **Terraform-IAC**: My infrastructure constellation, crafted with:  
  - Multi-AZ VPCs and NAT Gateways.  
  - Auto Scaling Groups for dynamic scaling.  
  - KMS-encrypted RDS and S3 storage.  
- **Serverless**: A nascent star cluster with Node.js Lambda potential (work in progress).

### 🔒 Fortress of Security
- **KMS Encryption**: Shields EBS, RDS, and S3 with unbreakable keys.  
- **Secrets Manager**: Safeguards credentials in a digital vault.  
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors the universe with dashboards and alarms.
